ðŸŽ² Roll Dice App â€“ Flutter Practice Project

This is a simple Roll Dice app built using Flutter as part of my practice to improve UI design and state management skills. The app displays a dice image and changes its face randomly (from 1 to 6) every time the user taps the "Roll Dice" button. The dice image updates based on a number generated using Dartâ€™s random number function, and the UI is styled with a clean gradient background for a modern look.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Built using Flutter and Dart.

Uses setState() for state updates.

Dice face changes dynamically with a button press.

Image updates using asset path interpolation (e.g., dice-1.png to dice-6.png).

Gradient background and large, clear text for a clean UI.

ðŸ“š What I Learned:
Basic widget structuring in Flutter.

Managing app state with StatefulWidget.

Working with image assets.

Creating custom UI with gradients and layout widgets like Column, TextButton, and Image.

This project helped me get hands-on experience with Flutter's core concepts and improved my confidence in mobile app development.
